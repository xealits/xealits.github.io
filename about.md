Hello! My name is Alex Toldaiev. This is my personal website.
I am a researcher in high energy particle physics, currently based at CERN.

My work is mostly about data analysis, testing future detector systems,
software performance on x86 CPUs and GPUs, Linux features,
and certain aspects of embedded software and instrumentation hardware.
I occasionally write posts on these topics or general reflections on physics.
And sometimes about things that inspire me, like painting or photography.
