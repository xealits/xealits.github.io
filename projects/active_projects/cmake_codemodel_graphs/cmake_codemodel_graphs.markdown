Use `CMake` text-api for useful graphs of the C++ projects.

More text.

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="./targetgraph-_cmake.svg">Browser doesn't support object tag for SVG</object>

This makes `<img/>` with the SVG, which strips the SVG UI:
```
![cmake](./targetgraph-_cmake.svg)
```


this does not work:
```
{\% svg "./targetgraph-_cmake.svg" \%}
```
